# Changelog

## Increment 2 - guide integration groundwork (2026-08-18)

- Ingested `data/Walter Ai-2026_Advanced_Fantasy_Guide.md` (sha-stamped) and
  built `src/parse_walter.py`: Evidence/Judgment extraction with verbatim,
  line-referenced quotes; 167 tags across 9 types; 19 Walter rank/ceiling/
  floor figures as a comparison series; Channel B structural knowledge
  (injury base rates, strategy definitions); change-log revision signals per
  player (last_revised, revision_direction, revision_count, subject-attributed).
- Name resolution: exact + nickname + fuzzy(0.90) against the ADP shard;
  0 unresolved, 0 guide-vs-live team conflicts on this parse.
- Extraction audit: 51.0% of the top 200 by ADP carry at least one tag
  (floor: 40%); 50 evidence / 117 judgment; quote fidelity mechanically
  verified against source line ranges (0 mismatches on prose quotes).
- Wrote MODEL.md: routing rule, channel caps, changelog signals, CVS and
  championship-objective designs of record.
- NOT DONE by design: nothing from the guide touches any rank. Gated on
  Anthony's approval of the classification sample (stop condition 1).
